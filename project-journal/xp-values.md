# XP Core Values Reflection
### Values Selected: Communication and Feedback

Throughout the Campus Marketplace project, our team focused on two XP values that were most relevant to our work: **Communication** and **Feedback**. Since we were working across multiple areas like backend, frontend, AWS, and the search feature, these values helped us stay organised and complete the project on time.

Below is how each team member followed these XP values during the project.

# 1. Communication

Our team depended a lot on clear and timely communication. We used WhatsApp, Jira, GitHub, and regular meetings to stay aligned. Whenever someone finished a task, got stuck, or needed help, we updated the team immediately. This helped us avoid confusion and kept our progress steady.

### Lam — Communication
- Regularly demonstrated new features like search and user registration.
- Shared updates quickly, especially during schema and API changes.
- Made sure the team understood sprint requirements and grading rules.
- Helped shift communication to WhatsApp for faster coordination.

### Vineet — Communication
- Explained grading breakdown clearly and reminded the team of deadlines.
- Shared AWS deployment updates and clarified infrastructure tasks.
- Coordinated final sprint tasks, especially for demo preparation.
- Communicated backend status whenever it affected the rest of the team.

### Wilson — Communication
- Updated the team whenever listing API or database logic changed.
- Shared endpoint documentation for smoother UI integration.
- Kept others informed about API readiness and testing status.
- Participated in technical discussions early when backend decisions impacted UI.

### Sakshat — Communication
- Shared UI progress and informed the backend team of integration needs.
- Asked for API details clearly, preventing tasks from getting stuck.
- Updated everyone quickly when build issues happened and when they were resolved.
- Coordinated with backend team during UI wiring and testing.

# 2. Feedback

Our team used quick feedback cycles to improve features and catch issues early. Whenever someone completed an API, UI component, or deployment step, we shared it immediately and took suggestions from others. This helped us refine the project faster without wasting time.

### Lam — Feedback
- Demonstrated the search feature and took suggestions from the team.
- Worked with Wilson to ensure schema compatibility.
- Helped the team prepare sprint reports and pointed out missing items.
- Assisted in debugging issues like build failures.

### Vineet — Feedback
- Gave suggestions during UI and backend demos.
- Provided feedback on AWS setup and how to improve deployment flow.
- Reviewed sprint progress and highlighted areas needing improvement.
- Helped refine search integration and tested the final build.

### Wilson — Feedback
- Provided input on API design, data structure, and integration.
- Reviewed Lam’s search logic for compatibility with listings.
- Gave feedback when UI integration needed backend changes.
- Helped clarify API payloads and expected responses for the team.

### Sakshat — Feedback
- Shared UI-based feedback after testing backend API responses.
- Reported build errors early and provided details to assist debugging.
- Tested merged backend features and suggested improvements where needed.
- Provided suggestions on UI layout and user experience.

# Conclusion

Our team followed **Communication** by staying in touch regularly, updating each other, and coordinating work properly. We followed **Feedback** by reviewing each other's work, giving suggestions, and fixing issues quickly. These two XP values helped us run all six sprints smoothly and complete the Campus Marketplace project on time.
